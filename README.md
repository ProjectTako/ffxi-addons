# ffxi-addons  
Some of the ffxi addons that I have made. Some are for both Windower and Ashita, and some are just for one or the other. If there is an addon made for one of them, but not the other and you are interested in having it made, feel free to contact me. You will be able to find more details about each addon in their respective folders.

Summer of the addons:  
  
AllSeeingEye:  
This was popularized long ago from the Windower 3.x plugin with the same name. Since the release of Windower v4, the Windower team has not provided an alternative, so I have. This one is simple to use. You load it, it's on. You unload it, it's off.  
  
EquipViewer:  
Overlays your currently equipped items onto the screen anywhere. Basically just shows your equipment screen, but smaller, anywhere you want, and you can make it translucent.  
  
Homepoints:  
Since the addition of Home Point warps was added, it was quickly figured out that you didn't actually need to unlock a Home Point crystal to be able to warp to it. This addon just 'unlocks' all Home Point warps, regardless of if you've unlocked them or not, including the non-existant Al Zahbi Home Point (do not warp there).  
  
Menus:  
Menus is an addon for Ashita that allows you to open your delivery box and the auction house anywhere in a zone that normally has those accessible. There is no safety check to look at your current zone and make sure it's one with those menus normally accessible.  
  
ScanZone:  
Scan Zone is an addon that will let you scan your current zone for any NPC, including mobs. This will make the server send your client an entity update packet, which it then reads for certain data and displays in the chat log, such as name, id, and position.  
  
TakoPop:  
This is an addon for Ashita that makes doing copious amounts of Voidwatch easier. It allows the user to buy more cells at a time from the NPCs, as well as initiate the voidwatch battle without the need to go through multiple menus. Supports displacers.
